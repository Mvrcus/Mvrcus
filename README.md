- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mvrcus
- 👀 I’m interested in all things related to web design and game design, including Java, JS, HTML, PHP, CSS, learning how these all work together to create something amazing. I also like digging into how the diff frameworks actually use the languages. Over time I’ve matured a bit as a dev, and I’ve come to learn (and love) some pretty awesome frameworks, like;  
- Laravel (PHP) for quick concept mock ups, theres so much prebuilt stuff that its stupid easy to build an app in a few hours as an MVP/Proof of Concept.  
- NextJS easily the most robust React framework I’ve used, steep learning curve but otherwise my go-to when I need something solid and fast.  
- VueJS lightweight, elegant, and just easy to work with. Vue’s single-file components and built-in reactivity make it super quick to pick up and maintain. 
- ExpressJS (Node.js) my go-to for building lightweight, fast, and scalable backend APIs. Minimal and unopinionated, with a ton of middleware options—perfect for REST APIs, microservices, and even just acting as a backend layer for SPAs and mobile apps.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and testing the bounds of AI, more specifically Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT, while mostly relying on Claude's Sonnet. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new business ventures centered around anything connected to the internet.
